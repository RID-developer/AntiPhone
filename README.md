# AntiPhone
Lightweight Tracker, and app blocker
To compile open android studio, atleast that's how i compiled it
Also this app requires special permissions from UsageStats manager which requires the user to manually go in the settings and enable it, android does not allow me to give a convenient notification about this
to do it go Settings -> apps -> special app access -> Usage access and enable my app
